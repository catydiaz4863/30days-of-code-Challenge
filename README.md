ENCODED MESSEGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For my first coding challenge I made an encryption/decryption program. You can either encrypt a messege and copy/paste it to the designated individual you want to send it to, or if you recive a encypted messege you can decrypt it. There are two types of encryption just so its not so consistent, theyre both extreemly similar but make a difference when entering compliated messeges.

The way it works
----------------
Before entering the word you will be asked what type of encryption either 1 or 2

After you will enter the messege like so..

"Hello world ."

When it goes into the encoding function it first swaps all the letters depending on which option you chose.
After that in changes the letters into another letter.

A = Z, B = Y, C = X .... M = N

And returns the encrypted messege.
To decrypt its the same thing just in opposite order.


--I also included for those who want to run it quick on the terminal--

//to compile

sudo g++ encrypt.cpp

//to execute

./a.out
